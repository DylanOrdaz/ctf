<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="na">author</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Guest Name</span>
<span class="na">profile_picture</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Source for the Picture</span>
<span class="na">author_site</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Author's Presence online</span>
<span class="na">author_stub</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Your Short Bio</span></code></pre></figure>
